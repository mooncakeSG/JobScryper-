   - Specify location (city, state, or "Remote")

2. **LinkedIn Credentials**:
   - Enter your LinkedIn email and password
   - These are only stored in your browser session and used for auto-apply functionality

3. **Resume Upload**:
   - Upload your resume in PDF or DOCX format
   - The file will be stored in the `assets/` folder with a timestamp

### Job Search Process

1. **Search Jobs**:
   - Select which sources to search (Indeed, LinkedIn, or both)
   - Click "Search Jobs" to start the process
   - View real-time progress as jobs are scraped and filtered

2. **Review Results**:
   - Jobs are displayed in expandable cards
   - Each job shows title, company, location, salary (if available), and description
   - Jobs are automatically scored for relevance to IT support roles

3. **Auto Apply**:
   - Click "Auto Apply" on LinkedIn jobs (Easy Apply only)
   - The system will automatically log into LinkedIn, navigate to the job, and submit your application
   - Applications are tracked in the "Applications" tab

### Application Tracking

- View all your applications in the "Applications" tab
- Filter by company, status, or date
- Export your application history as CSV
- Track daily and total application counts

## üîß Technical Details

### Job Filtering Algorithm

The application uses a sophisticated scoring system to identify relevant IT support jobs:

- **Primary Keywords**: IT Support, Helpdesk, Desktop Support, Technical Support
- **Secondary Keywords**: Troubleshooting, Hardware, Software, Windows, Microsoft
- **Technical Keywords**: Office 365, Active Directory, TCP/IP, VPN
- **Certifications**: CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Microsoft Certified

Jobs are scored based on:
- Title relevance (40% weight)
- Description keywords (30% weight)
- Location preference (20% weight)
- Company relevance (10% weight)

### Auto-Apply Process

The auto-apply feature handles:
- LinkedIn login and authentication
- Job page navigation
- Form field completion (contact info, work authorization, etc.)
- Resume upload
- Multi-step application processes
- Success/failure tracking

### Data Storage

- **Applications**: Stored in `applications.csv` with columns for job title, company, location, date, status, and URL
- **Resumes**: Stored in `assets/` folder with timestamps
- **Session Data**: Temporary storage in Streamlit session state

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Terms of Service Compliance

- **Respect Rate Limits**: The application includes delays between requests to avoid overwhelming job sites
- **LinkedIn Terms**: Auto-apply functionality is for personal use only and should comply with LinkedIn's terms of service
- **Be Respectful**: Don't spam applications - review job requirements before applying

### Privacy and Security

- **Credentials**: LinkedIn credentials are only stored in your browser session
- **Resume Data**: Files are stored locally in the `assets/` folder
- **No Data Sharing**: No personal information is shared with third parties

### Limitations

- **LinkedIn Easy Apply Only**: Auto-apply works only for LinkedIn jobs marked as "Easy Apply"
- **Captcha Challenges**: Manual intervention may be required for security challenges
- **Site Changes**: Web scrapers may need updates if job sites change their structure

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Playwright Installation Issues**:
   ```bash
   playwright install --with-deps
   ```

2. **LinkedIn Login Failures**:
   - Check your credentials
   - Ensure two-factor authentication is disabled or handled manually
   - Clear browser cache if using non-headless mode

3. **No Jobs Found**:
   - Try broader search terms
   - Check if job sites are accessible
   - Verify your internet connection

4. **Application Failures**:
   - Ensure your resume is in PDF or DOCX format
   - Check LinkedIn for any account restrictions
   - Verify that jobs are actually "Easy Apply" eligible

### Debug Mode

To run in debug mode (non-headless browser):
```python
# In apply.py, change:
auto_apply = AutoApply(email, password, resume_path, headless=False)
```

### Logs

Check the console output for detailed logs about the scraping and application process.
